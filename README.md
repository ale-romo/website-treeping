The project is about creating a publishing platform for visual storytelling. 
It's main feature is to be able to append each publication to a spatial position along a multidimentional(1) plane, as well as enabling the publications to be navigated via semantic fields(1).

(1) If it's easier this might be reduced to a bidimensional plane.
(2) The first semantic fields to be activated will be date of publishing and previous-next panel(s).

 * This video is an overall analysis of the medium including it's components, history and future. The most relevant aspects of the video are the ones that pertain what is referred as "the future of comics" and the "infinite canvas". Some aditional reading about the subject can be found in/at:

# Examples

* Subnormalty issue 189:
 * http://www.viruscomix.com/page556.html
 * This comic exemplifes a bidimesional navigation of a long series of parallel consequential events. A comic like this one would be candidate for the platform as currently it exist as a huge .jpeg that cannot be expanded upon.

* One zoom tree of life:
 * http://www.onezoom.org/life.html/
 * This interface can be considered an inspiration for how the comic might be rendered. Seems efficient enough for the great ammount of data is handling. Click and drag mode of navigation might not be optimal. Design is ugly.
 
* XKCD

 * XKCD Has several explorations into interactive comics experiences. Each exploration is self-contained and it's oun unique interaction dynamic.
 
 # Real world applications
 
 * For making "living" comics where panels can be added in any place at any moment and yet keep a coherent way of navigating them.
 * For journalism where material can be added as it is created/discovered. Using semantic filters things like "amarillismo" or opposite points of view can be highlighted in the whole body of the event.
 * For project planning as different aspects can be completed as they are defined.
